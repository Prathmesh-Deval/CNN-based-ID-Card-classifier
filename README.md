Not able to upload entire dataset here due to privacy issue, But you can collect and add your own images to dataset and run
data augmentation to create enough dataset from which we can train our module.


# import below necessary modules-

pip install
numpy,
keras,
sklearn,
cv2,
numpy,
tensorflow


# STEPS-
Run Data Augmntation.py
to create our dataset.

Now preporcess our data and train our model.

Use any new image to run Test model.py to see if our model prdicting correctly.
